# Random Earnings Bot

Random Earnings Bot is an open-source project aimed at building a cryptocurrency trading bot powered by AI, using modern automation tools and integration with major exchanges. The bot leverages advanced algorithms to monitor cryptocurrency market trends, providing users with automated trading strategies to optimize earnings. Our ultimate goal is to integrate the functionalities of Random Earnings with other projects, such as **Coexistence Board Chain** and **Learn 2 Learn**, to create a comprehensive trading and AI learning environment.

## Features
- **Automated Market Monitoring**: Integration with leading exchanges like Binance and CoinGecko, allowing real-time data fetching.
- **AI-Driven Trading Strategies**: Utilizes Dash2Trade and Bitsgap to implement strategies like Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), grid trading, and arbitrage.
- **Backtesting and Risk Management**: Includes features to test strategies on historical data and manage risks with stop-loss and take-profit functionalities.
- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Allows users to interact with the bot via Telegram, receive alerts, and execute trades directly from the chat interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python (with libraries like Telethon, python-dotenv, and Python-Telegram-Bot)
- **AI Tools**: Dash2Trade for strategy analysis and Bitsgap for automated trading execution.
- **Containerization**: Docker used for consistent deployment environments.
- **Cloud Integration**: Oracle and Azure services are used to support data storage, AI model training, and cloud deployment.

## Getting Started
To get started with Random Earnings Bot:
1. Clone the repository and set up a virtual environment.
2. Register a Telegram bot via BotFather and obtain your access token.
3. Configure environment variables using the `.env` file (do not forget to add it to `.gitignore`).
4. Start the bot and begin receiving market alerts and trading suggestions.

## Future Goals
- **Integration with Coexistence Board Chain** to provide community-based AI interaction and game features.
- **Scalable AI Models** that will learn from user interactions and market data to enhance predictive accuracy.
- **Enhanced Risk Management** with further automation for managing volatile market conditions.
